Migrating Oracle GoldenGate from the Classic Architecture to the Microservices Architecture within the same version (19c)

This involves several steps and considerations. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to perform this migration:

### Pre-Migration Checklist

1. **Backup Data**: Before beginning the migration, ensure all your configurations, trail files, and databases are fully backed up.
2. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure your current environment and all components are compatible with the Microservices Architecture.
3. **Documentation and Planning**: Review Oracle's official documentation for any specific prerequisites and considerations for migration.

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare the Environment
- Install the Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture (OGG MA) on the desired system. This can be the same system where Classic is installed or a different one.

```bash
# Example command to install OGG MA
unzip <OGG_ZIP_FILE>.zip
cd <OGG_DIRECTORY>
./oggca.sh
```

#### Step 2: Configure the Service Manager
- Start the Service Manager, which is the core component of the Microservices Architecture.

```bash
# Navigate to the OGG MA home directory
cd /path/to/ogg_microservices

# Start the Service Manager
./bin/ServiceManager
```

#### Step 3: Set Up the Microservices Deployment
- Access the Service Manager web interface (default URL is `http://hostname:port` where `port` is usually 9000).

- Configure the Deployment and create the necessary Distribution Paths and Receivers.


#### Step 4: Export and Import Configuration
- Use the Oracle GoldenGate Admin Client to export the configuration from the Classic architecture.

```bash
# Connect to the Classic deployment
./ggsci

# Export configuration
DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS <alias>
EXPORT CONFIG TOGGSCHEMA.xml
```
- Import the configuration into the Microservices deployment.

```bash
# Use the Admin Client for Microservices
./adminclient

# Connect to the Microservices deployment
CONNECT TO http://hostname:port


# Import configuration
IMPORT CONFIG FROMGGSCHEMA.xml
```


#### Step 5: Validate and Start Processes
- Ensure all paths are correctly set up and validate the configuration.
- Start the processes and begin the data replication.

```bash
# Start Extract and Replicat processes
START EXTRACT <extract_name>
START REPLICAT <replicat_name>
```


#### Step 6: Monitoring
- Use the Oracle GoldenGate Performance Metrics and the web interface to monitor the replication and handle any errors.

### Post-Migration
- Validate the data synchronization status.
- Decommission the old Classic architecture components after ensuring the Microservices deployment is stable.
