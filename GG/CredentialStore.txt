Add Credential Store
GGSCI> ADD CREDENTIALSTORE

This creates a credential store file under dircrd sub-directory.
cd $GG_HOME/dircrd/
ls
cwallet.sso

We see that the credential store has been created in the dircrd sub-directory located in the GoldenGate software installation home. If we need to create it in any other location like a shared file system, we have to specify that via the CREDENTIALSTORELOCATION parameter in the GLOBALS file.

Add User to Credential Store
GGSCI> alter credentialstore add user c##ogg1@oradb alias oggadmin_cdb

To view the User Id's stored in Credential Store, user INFO command
GGSCI> INFO CREDENTIALSTORE

Login to Golden Gate Using Alias
GGSCI> DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS oggadmin_cdb

Suppose we want to connect to one of the PDBs in that container database called PDB1
and want to create an alias for this connection and store it in the credential store as well.

GGSCI> ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE ADD USER c##ogg1@pdb1ogg1 ALIAS ogg_pdb1
GGSCI> INFO CREDENTIALSTORE

If there is a change in user password at DB level, you must update credential store
GGSCI> ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE REPLACE USER c##ogg1@oradb ALIAS oggadmin_cdb

To delete a user from credential store
GGSCI> ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE DELETE USER oggadmin_cdb
