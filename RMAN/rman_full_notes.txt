1) Oracle RMAN Basic Commands
=============================
10 years ago, my lack of understanding about How to backup Oracle database caused me to be unable 
to recover one development database for a client!

This early mistake made me learn everything about RMAN...

Specially, Oracle database backup types and how backup strategy can impact database recovery

Why?
Because you want to recover your database in case of crash.
It’ not possible to cover everything in the available space and
That's why we have so many books published on RMAN
But I can at least provide you the highly used RMAN commands here.
Are you ready !!!

{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL disk1 DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT ‘/disk1/%d_backups/%U’;
ALLOCATE CHANNEL disk2 DEVICE TYPE DISK FORMAT ‘/disk2/%d_backups/%U’;
BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
}

Incremental backup
==================
backup incremental level 0 database;
backup incremental level 1 database ;

Backup of CDB and PDB in 12c
============================
CDB backup
export ORACLE_SID=ORCL1
[oracle@rac1 ~]$ rman target /
RMAN> backup database plus archivelog;

CDB root backup
RMAN> backup pluggable database “CDB$ROOT”;

Backup pluggable database
backup pluggable database test;
backup pluggable database test plus archivelog;

By the way, what you are seeing here is not just the frequently used
RMAN commands. These are the same commands used by DBAs like
you to perform some serious database recoveries.

The main reason why these scripts are not for beginner DBA is
because one single RMAN mistake can lead to loss of entire database.

These scripts are for advanced DBA who have already worked on Oracle database.

For beginners, I would recommend to get yourself formal training in Oracle and then use these scripts.


3) Oracle RMAN Scripting
========================
RMAN Run Block File
Script file which will be called in backup script: /u02/rman/script/rman_run_cmd.rman

run
{
allocate channel ch1 device type disk format '/u02/rman/backup/PRODDB_DBFULL_BKP_%u';
allocate channel ch2 device type disk format '/u02/rman/backup/PRODDB_DBFULL_BKP_%u';
allocate channel ch3 device type disk format '/u02/rman/backup/PRODDB_DBFULL_BKP_%u';
crosscheck backup;
delete nopromtp obsolete;
backup database;
backup archivelog all delete input;
release channel ch1;
release channel ch2;
release channel ch3;
}


Shell Script file that will call above file
===========================================
/u02/rman/scripts/PRODDB_rman_bkp.sh

#!/bin/bash
. /home/oracle/.bash_profile
export DATE=$(date +%m%d%y_%H%M%S)
export ORACLE_HOME=/u02/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/dbhome_1
export ORACLE_SID=proddb
$ORACLE_HOME/bin/rman target / catalog rman_rc/rman_rc@rcat 
cmdfile=/u02/rman/script/rman_run_cmd.rman
log=/u02/rman/logs/${DATE}_proddb_BACKUP.log


4) Oracle RMAN Recovery Commands
================================
Preview Database Restore
RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE;
RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE;
RESTORE ARCHIVELOG FROM TIME ‘SYSDATE-7’ PREVIEW;
RESTORE DATABASE PREVIEW SUMMARY;
VALIDATE DATABASE;

RUN{
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c1 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
ALLOCATE CHANNEL c2 DEVICE TYPE DISK;
VALIDATE DATAFILE 1 SECTION SIZE 1200M;
}

VALIDATE DATAFILE 4 BLOCK 10 TO 13;
VALIDATE BACKUPSET 3;
RECOVER CORRUPTION LIST;

Recover database flashback technology
=====================================
SELECT OLDEST_FLASHBACK_SCN, OLDEST_FLASHBACK_TIME FROM V$FLASHBACK_DATABASE_LOG;
SELECT CURRENT_SCN FROM V$DATABASE;
SELECT NAME, SCN, TIME, DATABASE_INCARNATION#, GUARANTEE_FLASHBACK_DATABASE 
FROM V$RESTORE_POINT WHERE GUARANTEE_FLASHBACK_DATABASE=’YES’;

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO SCN 46963;
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO RESTORE POINT BEFORE_CHANGES;
FLASHBACK DATABASE TO TIME “TO_DATE(’09/20/05′,’MM/DD/YY’)”;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN READ ONLY;

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
STARTUP MOUNT
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;
SET UNTIL TIME ‘Nov 15 2004 09:00:00’;
SET UNTIL SEQUENCE 9923;
SET UNTIL RESTORE POINT before_update;
RESTORE DATABASE;
RECOVER DATABASE;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS;

Recover individual tablespace and datafile
==========================================
sql “alter tablespace working_data offline”;
sql “alter database datafile 13 offline”;
restore tablespace working_data;
restore datafile 13;
recover tablespace working_data;
recover datafile 13;
sql “alter tablespace working_data online”;
sql “alter database datafile 13 online”;
SWITCH DATAFILE 4 TO COPY;
RECOVER DATAFILE 4;
backup as copy datafile 4;


run{
SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE 4 TO ‘/oracle/oradata/tcstest/users01.dbf’;
restore datafile 4;
switch datafile 4;
recover datafile 4;
}

SET NEWNAME FOR DATAFILE ‘/disk1/oradata/prod/users01.dbf’ TO ‘/disk2/users01.dbf’;
RESTORE TABLESPACE users;
SWITCH DATAFILE ALL; # update control file with new filenames
RECOVER TABLESPACE users;

Recover individual block
========================
RECOVER DATAFILE 8 BLOCK 13 DATAFILE 2 BLOCK 199 FROM TAG mondayam;
RECOVER CORRUPTION LIST;

Recovery of database if inactive redo log is deleted
====================================================
sql> startup mount;
sql> alter database clear logfile group 2;
sql> alter database open;

Recovery after loss of controlfile
==================================
rman target /
startup nomount;
restore controlfile from autobackup;
alter database mount;
recover database;
alter database open (resetlogs);

Tablespace point in time recovery
=================================
Database should be in opened state

recover tablespace “APP_DATA” until time “to_date(‘2009-08-04 12:15:00’,’YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS’)”
auxiliary destination ’/opt/oracle/temp’;

Recovery after loss of current redolog file

RUN
{
# SET UNTIL TIME ‘Nov 15 2002 09:00:00’;
# SET UNTIL SCN 1000; # alternatively, specify SCN
SET UNTIL SEQUENCE 1; # alternatively, specify log sequence number
RESTORE DATABASE;
RECOVER DATABASE;
}

Alright, if you are wondering how to become RMAN expert and play
with above advanced scripts, here is the link to official Oracle RMAN
documentation .

Now it’s time for you to execute these commands in your test
environment and customize according to your database SIDs.

I know that was a lot of commands. But this was honestly
just the beginning ...

I didn’t even get to provide you with:
    ● Different database recovery scenarios (Full and Incremental)
    ● How to recover entire production database after server crash
    ● How to clone production to test database using RMAN
    ● Trigger Cumulative and Differential incremental backups

And without these steps, you won’t be able to become and RMAN
expert and perform RMAN activities like a pro.

So in the next 1-2 days I’ll be sending you some “insider”
information about them so you get to learn more.

And who knows… You may crack your next Oracle DBA interview ;)

These emails are going to surprise you A LOT, keep an eye on your Inbox.

Hope this helped!
