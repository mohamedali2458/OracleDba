Recently, I worked on a performance issue where a query was taking 18+ 
minutes to return results in production. The query was part of a 
financial reporting module and was impacting business users during peak hours.

Problem:
➡️ Large transactional table (~12M+ records)
➡️ Multiple joins
➡️ Function used in WHERE clause
➡️ No proper indexing on filter columns
➡️ Full Table Scan in execution plan

Checked the Execution Plan using EXPLAIN PLAN
➡️Full table scan
➡️High cost
➡️Filter predicate using trunc(date_column)

Query:

select *
from transactions t 
where trunc(t.transaction_date) = trunc(sysdate)
and t.status = 'success';

Using trunc() on an indexed column prevented index usage.

Optimized Query:

select *
from transactions t
where t.transaction_date >= trunc(sysdate)
and t.transaction_date < trunc(sysdate) + 1
and t.status = 'success';

Index Created:

create index idx_trans_date_status 
on transactions(transaction_date, status);

Result:

✅ Execution time reduced from 18 minutes → 12 seconds
✅Execution plan switched from Full Table Scan → Index Range Scan
✅CPU utilization reduced significantly














5 Database Performance Tips Every DBA Should Know

After years of managing enterprise databases, here are the essentials that make a real difference:

1. Regular Index Maintenance
Rebuild fragmented indexes monthly. A 30% fragmentation can slow queries by 50%.

2. Monitor Wait Events
Don't just look at CPU usage. Wait events tell you WHERE the bottleneck actually is.

3. Automate Your Backups
And test restores quarterly. A backup you can't restore is just wasted storage.

4. Implement Query Timeouts
One runaway query shouldn't bring down your entire system.

5. Keep Statistics Updated
Stale statistics = poor execution plans = frustrated users.
