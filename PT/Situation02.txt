Midnight DBA Panic → Perfect PDB Flashback Recovery!

Last night (Jan 7, 2026, around 1AM IST), Ex-DBA colleague calls PANICKING - accidentally DROPPED 
a guaranteed restore point that APP team needed for flashback. Email said "flashback to RP THEN drop", 
but DBA dropped RP first. It is one of their Critical Revenue DB 😱

 💯 My Action Plan (Don't Panic!) 

Step 1: keep Calm + Gather Facts

"Don't panic. Check what's still available."

Step 2: Verify Flashback Window ✅

SQL> SELECT FLASHBACK_ON FROM V$DATABASE;
YES. >> We are in safe zone.

SQL> SELECT OLDEST_FLASHBACK_TIME FROM V$FLASHBACK_DATABASE_LOG;
03-JAN-26 ← Perfect! Customer wanted 3:45AM EST on Jan 6th  ←that is Change was implemented on 2:15PM IST 

Step 3: Close Target PDB (CDB has 2 PDBs, don't disturb other)
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 CLOSE;

Step 4: Flashback PDB to Exact Time (even without restore point!)

FLASHBACK PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 
TO TIME TIMESTAMP '2026-01-06 08:45:00.00 +00:00'; -- 3:45AM EST = 8:45 UTC   
or 
we can also use SCN for the above timestamp as APP team said

Step 5: Open with Resetlogs

SQL> ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE PDB1 OPEN RESETLOGS;
Pluggable database altered.

Step 6: Verify Success


SQL>ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER = PDB1;
SQL> SELECT CURRENT_SCN FROM V$DATABASE; -- Matches flashback SCN
SQL> SELECT NAME, OPEN_MODE FROM V$PDBS; -- READ WRITE
Result: SUCCESS! 🎉

✅ PDB1 rewound to Jan 6, 3:45AM EST (customer exact requirement)
✅ Other PDB untouched - no downtime
✅ App team verified & happy

Key Learnings: 
READ EMAILS/TICKETS COMPLETELY before dropping restore points! 📧

Flashback window > Restore point name - SCN/time works even if dropped

PDB Flashback = Zero impact on other PDBs/CDB

Don't panic - 90% of "disasters" have recovery paths

Moral: As DBAs, our job isn't "no mistakes", it's "recover fast when they happen".
