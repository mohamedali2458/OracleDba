RAC Cluster Maintenance?
========================
How to bounce RAC cluster?
- using crsctl 

CRSCTL = Cluster Ready Service Control Utility

Why we need to bounce RAC cluster? 
- We bound RAC cluster for many reasons like patching, 
  any planned maintance, 
  for any configuration changes, 
  for any cluster administration. etc...

What is the impact on bouncing the cluster? 
- Bouncing the cluster will impact the running ASM instacne, 
  Database Inatance, 
  Services. 

Which user is autherised to bounce the cluster? 
- Oracle Database owner does not have previleges to bounce cluster services 
- GI/ASM owner does not have previlleges to bounce cluster services 
- Only root user can perform this activity 
- IN realtime world all the DBA will be having sudo su access 
  to root user so that DBA can login to root and perfrom this activity

Cluster Status Check and Cluster resource/deamons:
==================================================
crsctl check cluster
crsctl check cluster -all (From any nodes)
crsctl check cluster -n hostnode1
crsctl check cluster -n hostnode2

crsctl check crs (From all the nodes)
crsctl check css
crsctl check evm
crsctl check ctss
crsctl check has 

crsctl stat res -t  (here -t is for tabular format, we can give without it but format is not readable)
crsctl stat res -t -init (cluster resource details from same node)
ps -ef|grep d.bin

Note: Start stop are by root user. or by sudo to root user. check and status can be from any user.

How to Bounce the cluster services on a single node?
=====================================================
crsctl stop crs -f 
crsclt stop crs 

crsctl start crs 
crsctl check crs

crsctl stat res -t -init

How to Bounce the cluster services on a all cluster nodes?
==========================================================
crsctl stop cluster -all (From any nodes)
crsctl start cluster -all (From any nodes)

crsctl stop crs -f (From all the nodes)
crsclt stop crs (From all the nodes)

If ctssd not starting, 
locate ctssd.trc
/u01/app/oracle/diag/crs/hostnode1/crs/trace/octssd.trc
vi /u01/app/oracle/diag/crs/hostnode1/crs/trace/octssd.trc
go to end
