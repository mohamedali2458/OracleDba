What is HAS?
HAS stands for High Availability Services — it is the top-level Oracle Clusterware stack that manages all Oracle services on a node, including:

    Oracle Clusterware (CRS)
    Oracle High Availability Services Daemon (OHASD)
    All Grid Infrastructure resources

What Does crsctl stop has Do?
bash
# Must be run as ROOT
crsctl stop has

This command gracefully stops the entire Oracle High Availability Services stack on the local node, which includes:

What Gets Stopped	            Description
OHASD	                        Oracle High Availability Services Daemon
CRSD	                        Cluster Ready Services Daemon
CSSD	                        Cluster Synchronization Services Daemon
EVMD	                        Event Management Daemon
All DB Instances	            Any running Oracle instances on that node
ASM Instances	                Automatic Storage Management instances
Listeners	                    Oracle listeners managed by Grid
All GI Resources	            Everything registered with Clusterware


Key Points
⚠️ Must be run as root — not as oracle or grid user

bash
# Correct usage (as root)
su - root
crsctl stop has
# With force flag (if graceful stop hangs)
crsctl stop has -f


Comparison with Similar Commands
Command	                    Scope	            Stops What
crsctl stop has	            Local node only	    Entire HAS/GI stack
crsctl stop crs	            Local node only	    CRS stack (similar effect)
crsctl stop cluster	        All nodes	        Clusterware on all nodes
crsctl stop cluster -all	All nodes	        Entire cluster-wide
srvctl stop database	    DB level	        Only the database, not GI


When Would You Use It?
Scenario	                    Reason
OS patching	                    Bring down GI before OS maintenance
Grid Infrastructure patching	Apply GI/RU patches
Hardware maintenance	        Shutdown before physical work on node
Troubleshooting GI issues	    Restart the entire stack cleanly
Node eviction recovery	        Clean restart after a node was evicted


Start It Back Up
bash
# Start HAS again (as root)
crsctl start has
# Verify status after start
crsctl status resource -t

💡 Important: crsctl stop has only affects the local node where it is run. In a RAC cluster, other nodes continue to run normally — the database remains available through the surviving nodes (that's the beauty of RAC).
