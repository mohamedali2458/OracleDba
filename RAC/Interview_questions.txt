Q. Why subnet of scan IP, Virtual IP and public IP is same in case of RAC.
A. It makes network configuration simpler, meaning all these IPs can communicate directly 
within the same network and avoiding routing or additional configurations.

It also allows seamless failover and relocation of services between the nodes.

If a node hosting these IPs fails or need maintenance, other node(s) can take 
over the charge without changing the IP configuration, and clients continue 
using the same IP address.
