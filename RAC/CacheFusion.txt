What is Cache Fusion in Oracle RAC?

Cache Fusion is the heart of Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) ❤️

In a RAC environment, multiple database instances access the same database 
at the same time. Cache Fusion enables these instances to share data blocks 
directly through high-speed interconnect, without writing to disk.

How it works (Simply):
1. Each RAC instance has its own buffer cache
2. When one instance needs a data block already modified by another instance
3. Oracle transfers the block directly from memory to memory
4. No disk I/O → faster performance ⚡

Why Cache Fusion is important?
 ✅ Eliminates unnecessary disk reads
 ✅ Improves scalability
 ✅ Enables true active-active database architecture
 ✅ Ensures data consistency across nodes

In short:
 Cache Fusion = Fast data sharing + High availability + Better performance
