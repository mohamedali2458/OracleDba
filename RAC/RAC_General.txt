Instance Eviction
=================
Instance eviction occurs when Oracle RAC forcibly removes a problematic 
node from the cluster to protect data consistency.

🔹 When does eviction happen?
    * Private interconnect failure
    * Voting disk or OCR access loss
    * Network partition (split-brain risk)
    * Severe I/O or OS issues

🔹 What happens during eviction?
    * Affected instance is terminated
    * Locks are released
    * Surviving nodes perform instance recovery
    * Services and VIPs fail over

🔹 Key takeaway:
👉 Eviction is a safety mechanism, not a failure
    It keeps the RAC cluster stable and data safe.
