Oracle Data Guard Physical Standby Configuration
================================================
Primary details
SID: oradb
ORACLE_HOME: /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/db_1
Host Name: srv1.localdomain

Standby details
SID: oradb
ORACLE_HOME: /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/db_1
Host Name: srv2.localdomain

Assumption: we assume that primary server has a database (SID=oradb) up and running. 
The standby database has Oracle 19c installation done in the same oracle home location as primary.

Primary database changes
========================
Primary must run in archive log mode. Check the archive log mode

SELECT log_mode FROM v$database;
LOG_MODE
------------
NOARCHIVELOG
  
If it is not running in archive log mode, then enable it

SQL> shutdown immediate
SQL> startup mount
SQL> alter database archivelog;
SQL> alter database open;
SQL> archive log list;

Enable force logging on primary: In oracle, users can restrict redo generation 
for SQL by using NOLOGGING clause. 
This NOLOGGING transaction will be a problem for physical standby. Hence, we 
force logging so even user uses NOLOGGING clause, every SQL will be logged on to redo.

SQL> alter database force logging;
SQL> select name, db_unique_name, force_logging from v$database;

Standby file management: We need to make sure whenever we add/drop datafile in primary 
database, those files are also added / dropped on standby.

SQL> show parameter standby_file_management;
SQL> alter system set standby_file_management = 'AUTO';

Create standby log files: You must create standby log files on primary. These files are 
used by a standby database to store redo it receives from primary database. Our primary 
may become standby later and we would need them, so better to create it. First check the 
current log groups

SQL> select GROUP#, THREAD#, bytes/1024/1024/1024 size_gb, MEMBERS, STATUS from v$log order by 1;

    GROUP#    THREAD# BYTES/1024/1024    MEMBERS STATUS
---------- ---------- --------------- ---------- ----------------
         1          1             200          1 INACTIVE
         2          1             200          1 CURRENT
         3          1             200          1 INACTIVE

SQL> select member from v$logfile;

MEMBER
---------------------------------------------------
/u01/data/db_files/ip7/redo03.log
/u01/data/db_files/ip7/redo02.log
/u01/data/db_files/ip7/redo01.log

Add the standby logfiles, make sure group number should be from a different series like 
in this case we choose to start with 11 and above. This helps in easy differentiation.

Make sure to keep the thread# and logfile size exactly same. Oracle also recommends to 
always create n+1 standby log files. 
Where n is the total number of logfiles

ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 11 '/u01/data/db_files/ip7/stb_redo1.log' SIZE 200M;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 12 '/u01/data/db_files/ip7/stb_redo2.log' SIZE 200M;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 13 '/u01/data/db_files/ip7/stb_redo3.log' SIZE 200M;
ALTER DATABASE ADD STANDBY LOGFILE THREAD 1 GROUP 14 '/u01/data/db_files/ip7/stb_redo4.log' SIZE 200M;

Check the standby log files via below query

SQL> SELECT GROUP#,THREAD#,SEQUENCE#,ARCHIVED,STATUS FROM V$STANDBY_LOG;

Enable flashback on primary: Flashback database is highly recommended because in case of 
failover, you need not re-create primary database from scratch.

SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest_size=45g;
SQL> alter database flashback on;
SQL> select flashback_on from v$database;

If flashback parameters are not set properly, use below commands

SQL> show parameter recovery;
SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest='/u01/app/oracle/fast_recovery_area';
SQL> alter system set db_recovery_file_dest_size=45g;
SQL> alter database flashback on;

Check DB Unique name parameter on primary: Make sure your primary database has DB_UNIQUE_NAME 
parameter set for consistency. If it’s not set properly, use ALTER SYSTEM SET command

SQL> show parameter db_name
NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- -------------
db_name                              string      ip7

SQL> show parameter db_unique_name
NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- -------------
db_unique_name                       string      ip7


Configure network
=================
Use below tns entries and put them under ORACLE user HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora. 
Change host as per your environment and execute on both primary and standby.

Notice the use of the SID, rather than the SERVICE_NAME in the entries. This is important 
as the broker will need to connect to the databases when they are down, so the services 
will not be present.

vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora

ip7 =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = srv1.dbagenesis.com)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SID = ip7)
    )
  )

ip7_stb =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = srv2.dbagenesis.com)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SID = ip7)
    )
  )


Configure listener on primary database. Since the broker will need to connect to the database 
when it’s down, we can’t rely on auto-registration with the listener, hence the explicit entry 
for the database.

vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = srv1.dbagenesis.com)(PORT = 1521))
    )
  )

SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = ip7_DGMGRL)
      (ORACLE_HOME = /u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0.1)
      (SID_NAME = ip7)
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = /u01/app/oracle

Configure listener on standby. Since the broker will need to connect to the database when it’s down, 
we can’t rely on auto-registration with the listener, hence the explicit entry for the database.

vi $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = srv2.dbagenesis.com)(PORT = 1521))
    )
  )

SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = ip7_stb_DGMGRL)
      (ORACLE_HOME = /u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0.1)
      (SID_NAME = ip7)
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = /u01/app/oracle

Once the listener.ora changes are in place, restart the listener on both servers

lsnrctl stop
lsnrctl start


Configure redo transport
========================
Note: if you plan to use Oracle Data Guard broker, then you can skip this section 
“configure redo transport” and jump to “Build Standby” section.

Configure redo transport from primary to standby:  The below statement says that if 
the current database is in primary role, then transport logs to standby. We need to 
change service and db_unique_name for same parameter on standby server.

On Primary Server
=================
SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_2 = 'service=ip7_stb async valid_for=(online_logfiles,primary_role) db_unique_name=ip7_stb';

Set FAL_SERVER: Fetch Archive Log parameter tells primary as to where it will get archives from

On Primary Server
=================
SQL> alter system set fal_server = 'ip7_stb';

Set dg_config parameter: This parameter defines which databases are in data guard configuration

On Primary Server
=================
SQL> alter system set log_archive_config = 'dg_config=(ip7,ip7_stb)';


Build standby
=============
Create pfile on primary, open it and create the necessary directories on the standby server

On Primary Server
=================
SQL> create pfile from spfile;
exit

$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
$ cat initip7.ora

On Standby Server
=================
Create directories as you find in the initip7.ora file

mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/admin/ip7/adump
mkdir -p /u01/data/db_files/ip7
mkdir -p /u01/FRA/ip7

On standby server, create parameter file with just db_name parameter and start the 
instance in nomount mode

On standby server
=================
vi $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/initip7.ora
*.db_name='ip7'

$ export ORACLE_SID=ip7
$ sqlplus / as sysdba

SQL> STARTUP NOMOUNT;
SQL> exit;

--you must exit from sqlplus, else cloning will fail

Copy password file: Copy the password file from primary to standby server

$ scp orapwip7 oracle@srv2:$ORACLE_HOME/dbs

If no password file exists, create one via below command and then copy

orapwd file=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapwip7 force=y

Duplicate primary database via RMAN: On primary, connect to RMAN, specifying a full connect string 
for both the TARGET and AUXILIARY instances. Do not attempt to use OS authentication else, 
the cloning will fail

To DORECOVERY option starts recovery by applying all available logs immediately after restore

On primary server
=================
rman target sys@ip7 auxiliary sys@ip7_stb

RMAN> DUPLICATE TARGET DATABASE FOR STANDBY 
FROM ACTIVE DATABASE DORECOVER 
SPFILE 
SET db_unique_name='ip7_stb'
SET fal_server='ip7'
SET log_archive_dest_2='service=ip7 async valid_for=(online_logfiles,primary_role) db_unique_name=ip7'
NOFILENAMECHECK;

Once cloning is done, you should see below at RMAN prompt

Finished Duplicate Db at 07-DEC-2015

  
Enable flashback on standby: As we know the importance of flashback in data guard, we must 
enable it on standby as well

On Standby Server
=================
SQL> alter database flashback on;

Bounce database & start MRP (Apply Service): It's good to bounce standby, put it in mount mode 
and start MRP process

On Standby Server
=================
SQL> shut immediate;
SQL> startup mount;
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database disconnect;


Verify standby configuration
============================
Once MRP is started, we must verify which archive log number MRP is applying on standby

On standby:
===========
select process, status, sequence# from v$managed_standby;

select sequence#, applied, first_time, next_time, name filename 
from v$archived_log 
order by sequence#;

Below queries will help you identify issues when your data guard setup is out of sync

On both primary & standby:
==========================
set lines 999;
select * from v$dataguard_status order by timestamp;

select dest_id, status, destination, error from v$archive_dest where dest_id<=5;

IF you see ORA-16058, do this on primary:
=========================================
SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2='DEFER';
SQL> alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2='ENABLE';
SQL> select dest_id, status, destination, error from v$archive_dest where dest_id<=2;

On primary:
===========
select sequence#, first_time, next_time, applied, archived 
from v$archived_log 
where name = 'ip7_stb' 
order by first_time;

select STATUS, GAP_STATUS from V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS where DEST_ID = 2;

archive log list;
Configure Archive deletion policy: We must set this policy in order to prevent accidental 
deletion of archive logs on primary database

On Primary:
===========
rman target / 
configure archivelog deletion policy to applied on all standby;
