Oracle Data Guard Manual Switchover and Failover on Physical Standby

Switchover
==========
Perform Manual Switchover on Physical Standby

Connect to proddb database via client and keep querying below

sqlplus sys/sys@proddb as sysdba

select name, open_mode, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;

NAME      OPEN_MODE      DB_UNIQUE_NAME         DATABASE_ROLE
--------- -------------- ---------------------- --------------
proddb    READ WRITE     proddb                 PRIMARY

Check primary and standby for any gaps

On primary:
===========
select STATUS, GAP_STATUS from V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS where DEST_ID = 2;

On standby:
===========
select NAME, VALUE, DATUM_TIME from V$DATAGUARD_STATS;

We will first convert primary to standby and later standby to primary

On primary:
===========
select SWITCHOVER_STATUS from V$DATABASE;

You must see TO STANDBY or SESSIONS ACTIVE

alter database commit to switchover to physical standby with session shutdown;

startup mount;

At this stage, there is no primary to accept queries from client. Run below query 
on client putty terminal. The query will hang and wait until standby is converted to primary

select name, open_mode, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;

Convert standby to primary: Our primary is already converted to standby. Now it’s time 
to convert original standby into primary

select SWITCHOVER_STATUS from V$DATABASE;

alter database commit to switchover to primary with session shutdown;

alter database open;

At this stage, the client query would execute successfully!


On new standby – Initially your primary database: Start MRP

alter database recover managed standby database disconnect;

Revert back: Once again follow the above process from top and re-execute steps 
in proper databases to revert back to original setup.


Perform Failover to Standby
===========================
Failover is when your primary database is completely lost.  When there is a failover, 
standby is converted into primary but primary is not converted into standby as it is lost. 
If you do not have Flashback enabled on primary, you must re-create primary from 
scratch (Using RMAN duplicate method). In this example, we have already enabled flashback 
on both primary and standby.

Our current physical standby server overview

Primary Database  = Proddb
Physical Standby  = proddb_st


Crash Primary database

Let’s crash primary (proddb): In order to simulate failure, we will shut down 
the primary server proddb. As root user, shutdown the server without shutting down DB.

Execute query on client: At this stage, there is no primary to accept queries from 
client. Run below query on client putty terminal. The query will hang and wait 
until standby is converted to primary

select name, open_mode, db_unique_name, database_role from v$database;


Perform Failover to Standby

Minimize data loss (proddb): If you can mount the primary database, then 
flush the logs to standby

On primary:
===========
SQL> startup mount
SQL> alter system flush redo to 'proddb_st';

If you are not able to mount the database, then check if primary server is up. In 
that case manually copy archive logs from primary to standby and register those 
logs on standby database

On standby:
===========
SQL> alter database register physical logfile '&logfile_path';

Check for redo gaps: If any gap exists, copy log files from primary and register 
on standby as per last step

On standby:
===========
SQL> select THREAD#, LOW_SEQUENCE#, HIGH_SEQUENCE# from V$ARCHIVE_GAP;

Start failover: We need to activate standby so that client can continue to access 
even after failover

On standby:
===========
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE CANCEL;
SQL> ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE FINISH;
SQL> select SWITCHOVER_STATUS from V$DATABASE;

You must see TO PRIMARY or SESSIONS ACTIVE. Switch standby to primary

SQL> alter database commit to switchover to primary with session shutdown;
SQL> alter database open;

Check client query: Check the query you executed in step 2 on client, it must get executed


Rebuild Primary After Failover

Post failover, there are two methods of rebuilding your failed primary
  Method 1: Rebuild from scratch à RMAN duplicate
  Method 2: Flashback database à only if Flashback was enabled

Note: In our earlier activity, we have performed Failover. Current state of your servers should be
​proddb                ​ crashed (we shutdown the server)
proddb_st              Primary

Get the SCN at which standby became primary: We need to get the SCN at which the current primary(proddb_st) 
was activated. This SCN will be used to flashback crashed (proddb) database

SQL> select to_char(standby_became_primary_scn) from v$database;

Flashback crashed primary(proddb): Start the proddb server, mount the database and flashback proddb to SCN from the last step

SQL> startup mount;
SQL> flashback database to scn <standby_became_primary_scn>;

Convert crashed primary to physical standby(proddb): Now the old primary is at SCN when proddb_st was activated. 
We can convert proddb into a physical standby and start redo apply

SQL> alter database convert to physical standby;
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database disconnect;

Current state of your databases should be
proddb              Physical Standby
proddb_st           Primary

Revert to original configuration: At this stage, if you would like to revert the current state of databases to 
original, you can perform manual switchover!
