Oracle Database has 3 startup sequence
======================================
startup nomount; 
- In this nomount stage it will read spfile if not pfile if not then it will throw an
error message stating unable to find parameter file.

startup mount; 
alter database mount;
- This mount stage will come after nomount, In this mount stage it will read 
controlfile. In case if no controlfile found then it will throw an error message 
stating unable to find the controlfiles.

startup; or startup open; 
alter database open;
- This open stage will come after mount, In this open stage it will read datafile 
and online redo log files. In case if no datafile/redo log files found then it will 
throw an error message stating unable to find the datafiles/redo log files. 



Redo Logs vs Archive Logs – A Must-Know Concept for Every DBA
=============================================================
In Oracle Database, Redo Logs and Archive Logs play a crucial role in data protection and recovery.
Understanding the difference is fundamental for both daily DBA operations and interview discussions.
🔹 Redo Logs
-->Record every change made to the database
-->Used for instance recovery (after crash or shutdown)
-->Continuously written by LGWR
-->Stored as online redo log files
-->Circular in nature (overwritten)

🔹 Archive Logs
-->Copies of filled redo logs (when DB is in ARCHIVELOG mode)
-->Used for media recovery and point-in-time recovery
-->Generated by ARCH (Archiver) process
-->Stored separately (archive destination)
-->Required for Data Guard, backups, and recovery

⚠️ Why this difference matters in production:
-->Without redo logs → no crash recovery
-->Without archive logs → no point-in-time or media recovery
-->Missing archive logs can lead to data loss
-->Full archive destination can hang the database

📌 DBA Golden Rule:
Redo logs keep the database running,
Archive logs keep the business protected.





Topic : Redo Log File Management.
================================
Redo log files are critical in Oracle because they record every change made to the database. 
They help Oracle recover data after failures.

💥What Are Redo Log Files?
 • Store redo entries (change records)
 • Written by LGWR process
 • Required for instance & crash recovery

--> Types of Log Switch
Manual Log Switch → Triggered by DBA

ALTER SYSTEM SWITCH LOGFILE;
Automatic Log Switch → Happens when current redo log becomes full

💥Redo Log File Status & Meaning
Status	Meaning
CURRENT -	Currently being written by LGWR
ACTIVE -	Needed for recovery, not yet reusable
INACTIVE - No longer needed, can be reused
UNUSED - Never used since creation

1)Check Redo Log Status
SELECT group#, status FROM v$log;
SELECT member FROM v$logfile;

2)Add Redo Log Group
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE
GROUP 4 ('/u01/oradata/redo04.log') SIZE 200M;

3)Add Member
ALTER DATABASE ADD LOGFILE MEMBER
'/u02/oradata/redo01b.log' TO GROUP 1;

4)Drop Redo Log Group
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE GROUP 4;

5)Drop Redo Log Member
ALTER DATABASE DROP LOGFILE MEMBER

📌 DBA Tips
 • Use multiplexing for safety
 • Avoid dropping CURRENT or ACTIVE redo logs
 • Monitor frequent log switches
