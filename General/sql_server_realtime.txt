🚨 Production Down at 2 AM – A Real DBA Lesson

Last month, we received a P1 alert at 2:07 AM.
Critical banking application was completely unresponsive.

As a SQL DBA, this is where theory meets reality.

🔎 Initial Findings:
	•	CPU at 95%
	•	Blocking sessions piling up
	•	One stored procedure running for 40+ minutes
	•	TempDB growing rapidly

Instead of restarting SQL Server (which is never the first solution), we followed a structured approach:

✅ Identified the blocking chain using sp_who2 and DMVs
✅ Found a missing index causing a massive table scan (20M+ rows)
✅ Execution plan showed parameter sniffing issue
✅ Applied query hint as immediate fix
✅ Created optimized covering index after impact analysis

⏱️ Within 18 minutes, application was stable.


💡 What I learned;
1. Restart is not a solution. Root cause analysis is.
2. Indexing strategy can make or break production systems.
3. Monitoring + Calm mindset > Panic.
4. Every DBA should master execution plan reading.

Being a DBA is not about running backups.
It’s about protecting business continuity.
