Row chaining, how does it happen? How can you reduce it? How do you correct it ?
================================================================================
Row chaining occurs when a VARCHAR2 value is updated and the length of the new 
value is longer than the old value and would not fit in the remaining block 
space. This results in the row chaining to another block. It can be reduced 
by setting the storage parameters on the table to appropriate values. It can 
be corrected by export and import of the effected table.

Row chaining occurs in Oracle databases when a single row of data cannot fit 
into a single database block due to its size.

This can lead to performance issues as multiple blocks need to be accessed to 
retrieve a single row. 

How Row Chaining Happens

1. Large Rows: When a row is too large to fit into a single block. This often 
occurs with tables that have large columns such as BLOB, CLOB, or VARCHAR2 
columns that store a lot of data.

2. Block Size Limitation: Oracle database blocks have a fixed size 
(e.g., 8KB, 16KB, etc.). If the data for a row exceeds this size, 
the row must be split across multiple blocks.

3. Insertion of Data: When data is inserted, if the remaining space in a block 
is insufficient to hold the entire row, Oracle splits the row into pieces, 
chaining them across multiple blocks.
