Oracle Networking - I
=====================
Utilities to configure Listener and TNS Service:
netmgr:	network manager
netca:	network configuration assistant

Location:
default location of listener.ora and tnsnames.ora is:
$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin

Contents of listener.ora
LISTENER(listener name) =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = mahi-PC)(PORT = 1521))
  )  
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = db1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\app\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1)
      (SID_NAME = db1)
    )
  )
ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\app\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1\log


Tnsnames.ora
DB1 =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = mahi-PC)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = db1)
    )
  )


Listener control utility
$lsnrctl
$lsnrctl 	<option> 	listener_name
		reload	to reload the settings of listener file
		status	to see the status of listener
		start		to start the listener
		stop		to stop the listener
		services	db/instances currently serve by

$lsnrctl <enter>
$lsnrctl>

Checking listener at  OS level
$ps -ef | grep tns

Testing Oracle Networking
$tnsping <service_name> 
$tnsping db1

TNS_ADMIN, TWO_TASK environment variable

TNS_ADMIN
---------
Changing default location of listener and tnsname files
Syntax:
$lsnrctl stop list_primdb
$export TNS_ADMIN='/u01'
$cd $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
$mv listener.ora /u01
$lsnrctl start list_primdb
Now the system looks for listener.ora in /u01
$echo $TNS_ADMIN
will show /u01

TWO_TASK
--------
To set the tns service alias one time.
We can use TWO_TASK Environment Variable:
$export TWO_TASK=<tnsservice-name>
$export TWO_TASK=primdb

after setting the TWO_TASK environment variable we can do the following:
$sqlplus u1/u1      (no need of giving @tnsservice)

Creating and deleting an environment variable in bash
Test if the DUALCASE variable exists:
$env | grep DUALCASE
nothing
If does not, so create the variable and export it:
$DUALCASE=1
export DUALCASE
Check if it is there:
env | grep DUALCASE
DUALCASE=1
It is there.  So get rid of it:
$unset DUALCASE
Check if it's still there:
env | grep DUALCASE
nothing

Shared Server Architecture(SSA)
What ? A shared server process can serve multiple user sessions.
The sessions communicate to Shared Server processes through Dispatcher process.
