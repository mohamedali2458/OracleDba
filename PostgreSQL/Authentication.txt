PostgreSQL Internal Authentication
==================================
Postgres manages internal authentication mechanism as is mentioned in pg_hba.conf file.

cat $PGDATA/pg_hba.conf | grep -i method
# METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5", "password", "scram-sha-256"
# authentication methods -- refer to the "Client Authentication"

Note: is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows bidirectional data 
exchange between processes running


type	database	user 	address		method

column 1:
	Local is used the Unix-Domain socket, if is a host mention the host IP address in the address domain.

col 2:
	Used for the database, mention the database name.
	If its has been set to all, then all the databases of PostgreSQL cluster will use the same authentication mechanism.

col 3:
	If it is the user, It can be set to separate authentication methods for different users and "all" means for all users.

col 4:
	IP address for example IP address can use particular authentication method.

col 5:
	which auth mode of authentication has to used.

Auth method - trust
-------------------
A user who is mentioned with trust does not require any password for authentication.

Example
# TYPE		DATABASE	USER	ADDRESS		METHOD
  host		all		all	127.0.0.1/32	trust

any host which is not local host that connection will be rejected

md5 authentication:
	When using the md5 authentication, you havve to provide the password.

SCRAM Authentication:
	It is one of the most secure authentication methods, uses cryptographically-hashed security mechanism to store the passwords on the system.
