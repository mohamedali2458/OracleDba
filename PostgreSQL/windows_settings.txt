To set the PostgreSQL path in Windows, you need to add the path to the PostgreSQL bin 
directory to your system's Environment Variables. This allows you to use command-line 
tools like psql from any command prompt window.

Step-by-Step Guide
==================
Locate the PostgreSQL bin directory. The default installation path is usually similar 
to C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin, where <version> is your installed 
PostgreSQL version (e.g., 16, 15, 14).

Open the "Environment Variables" editor.
Press the Win + R keys to open the Run dialog.
Type sysdm.cpl and press Enter to open the "System Properties" window.

Alternatively, search for "Edit the system environment variables" in the Windows search 
bar and select the matching result.

Access the Environment Variables.
In the "System Properties" window, go to the Advanced tab.
Click the Environment Variables... button at the bottom.
Edit the Path variable.

In the "Environment Variables" window, under the System variables section (or User variables 
if you don't have administrator privileges or only want it for your account), find the Path 
variable and select it.

Click the Edit... button.

Add the PostgreSQL bin path.

In the "Edit environment variable" window, click the New button.

Paste the path you copied earlier (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin) into the new row. 
You may also optionally add the lib directory path (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\lib).

Click OK to save the new path, and then OK on the other windows to close them out.

Verify the installation.
Close and reopen any existing Command Prompt or PowerShell windows for the changes to take effect.
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and type the following command:
bash
psql --version
If the path is set correctly, it should display the PostgreSQL version. You can then connect to the database using psql -U postgres and entering your password when prompted.
