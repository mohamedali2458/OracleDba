Oracle Administrator Question & Answers
***************************************
1) State five duties of an Oracle DBA?
    Duties of a DBA might include software and hardware installation, 
    configuration of new hardware and software, security, performance tunning, 
    backup and recovery, routine maintenance, trouble shooting and failure recovery.
 	
2) What is the primary duty of the DBA?
    The primary duty of the DBA is to protect the database and provide continuous 
    access to that data for the user community.

3) What is database?
    Databse is a structure that stores information about multiple types of entities, 
    the attributes (or characteristics) of the entities, and the relationships among the entities.
	
4) What is a database instance?
     A database instance is a set of memory structure and background processes that 
     access a set of database files. The processes can be shared by all of the users.

5) What is the differnece between DBMS and RDBMS?
    DBMS is program that defines rules for data stroage and retrival,
    RDBMS is special type of DBMS that stores the data in relational 
    format as described in the relational.

6) What are the components of an oracle instance ?
     Background process and memory structures.

7) What are the components of sga ?
     Buffer cache, log buffer, shared pool, large pool,  and java pool.

8) Why do you need pga?
     It is a memory area used by oracle instance. it is requried to strore 
     session specific information.

9) What are the different types of memory structures available in oracle?
     Shared Global Area (SGA) and Program Global Area(PGA)

10) What is database writer(DBWR) ?
       It writes changed data blocks (dirty blocks) from buffer cache to datafile.

11) When does DBWR write to the datafile?
       When checkpoint occurs
       When number of dirty blocks reaches a threshold
       Every three seconds due to timeout
       When server process needs free space in buffer cache to read new blocks

11) What are the differences between clustered and a non-clustered index?
      A clustered index is a special type of index that reorders the way 
      records in the table are physically stored. Therefore table can have 
      only one clustered index. The leaf nodes of a clustered index contain 
      the data pages. 

      A Nonclustered index is a special type of index in which the logical 
      order of the index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on disk.

12) What is a Tablespace?
       A database is divided into Logical Storage Units called tablespaces. 
       A tablespace is used to group related logical structures together.

13) Why we use materialized views instead of a table?
      Materialized views are basically used to increase query performance 
      since it contains results of a query. They should be used for reporting 
      instead of a table for a faster execution.

14) What are the different Oracle database objects?
       TABLES
       VIEWS
       INDEXES
       SYNONYMS
       SEQUENCES
       TABLESPACES

15) What is schema?
       A schema is collection of database objects of a user.

16) What are Roles?
      Roles are named groups of related privileges that are granted to users or other roles.

17) What are the dictionary tables used to monitor a database spaces ?
      DBA_FREE_SPACE
      DBA_SEGMENTS
      DBA_DATA_FILES

18) Explain the difference between a data block, an extent and a segment?
      A data block is the smallest unit of logical storage for a database 
      object. As objects grow they take chunks of additional storage that 
      are composed of contiguous data blocks. These groupings of contiguous 
      data blocks are called extents. All the extents that an object takes 
      when grouped together are considered the segment of the database object.

       alter database backup control file to trace;

20) What is difference between UNIQUE constraint and PRIMARY KEY constraint?
       A column defined as UNIQUE can contain Nulls while a column defined 
       as PRIMARY KEY can't contain Nulls. A table can have only one primary key.

21) What is a data segment?
      Data segments are the physical areas within a database block in which 
      the data associated with tables and clusters are stored.

22) Name a tablespace, which is automatically created when you create a database?
      The system tablespace is created automatically during database creation.

23) Which flle is accessed first when you start an oracle database?
       Parameter file, and spfile. 

24) What are the advantages of using spfile?
       It supports dynamic changes in parameter values.
       The changes in spfile can only be made by using in oracle statements.
       Backup of spfile is possible through RMAN.

25) How do you view parameter values when you are using pfile or spfile?
      Show parameter command from sql*plus and query v$paramter command 
      view to see values of the paqramters.

      show parameter spfile;

26) How can you convert spfile to pfile and pfile to spfile?
      sql> create spfile from pfile;
      sql> create pfile from spfile;
      sql> create spfile from memory;
      sql> create pfile from memory;

21) How can you backup the parameter files?
      In Rman 
      RMAN> configure controlfile autobackup on;
      In Rman restore an spfile
      RMAN> restore controfile from autobackup;

22) What happen alter a user process fails?
       PMON clean up the memory after user process fails. 

21) What is the difference between database and instance?
       Database is a collection of data files that contain the information of interest; whereas, instance is the combination of background processes and memory structure.

41) What is the difference between incremental backup and differential backup?
      Both, incremental and differential backup files that have been modified or created after the previous backup. However, attributes are reset after the incremental backup but after the differential backup.

42) Which files must be backed up?
      Database files
      Control files
      Archived log files

43) What is the use of Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR)?

44) What are the different types of connection load balancing?
      Server side load balancing
      Client side load balancing

45) What is system change number?
       SCN is an ID that Oracle generates for every transaction. It is recorded with the corresponding change in a redo entry.

46) What is an SID?
       The SID is the system identifier. This environment variable is used to determine which database to connect to.

47) What is the difference between hot backup and cold backup?
       Hot backup is taken when database is still online while cold backup is taken when database is offline.
       Database needs to be in the archive log mode for the hot backup but there is no such requirement for the cold backup.

48) What Oracle object is used for recovery operations?
      The redo log files and the archieve log files are used for database recovery.

49) What is the difference between hot backup and cold backup?
      Hot backup is taken when database is still online while cold backup is taken when database is offline.
      Database needs to be in the archive log mode for the hot backup but there is no such requirement for the cold backup.

      Log buffer
      Shared pool
      Large pool
      Java pool

52) What is a synonym?
       A synonym is simply an alias to another object in the database. This object can be a table, view, sequence or program unit.

53) What is archive log file?
       Archive log file stores redo log information persistentiy. A redo log is overwritten with time; therefore, archive log maintains that lost information.

54) What is a backup set?
      Backup set is a logical grouping of backup files that are created when you issue an RMAN backup command. It is RMANs name for a collection of files associated with a backup. A backup set is composed of one or more backup pieces.
 	
51) What does database tier consist of?
      Database tier consists of Oracle database, which stores all the data. The database server contains Oracle Home and data files.

52) What is an interconnect network?
       An interconnect network is a network between nodes of a cluster. It uses switches to ensure that only nodes can access this network. Generally, this is a high speed connection.
 	
53) What is a shared server process?
      The shared server process handles more than one user process. The dispatcher queues the job and the shared server process executes it.
 
54) What is the parameter file?
      The parameter file is a file that contains additional command line parameters.

55) What is rolling upgrade?
       Rolling upgrade refers to the software upgrade while database is still functional without bringing the database down for upgrade. This is the new feature of Oracle 11g.

56) What is the difference between SPFILE and PFILE?
      Oracle can use both SPFILE and PFILE as initialization parameter files.
      SPFILE is a binary file while PFILE is a text file.
      You can change the values in PFILE by directly by editing it but those changes would not take effect until the restart of the database.
 
57) What is RAC?
      Real application cluster (RAC) is a clustering solution.
      It ensures high availability for database application.
      A RAC setup contains at least two nodes for a database.
      RAC provides high availability and load balancing through these nodes.

58) How do you control the maximum number of redo log files in a database?
      The maximum number of redo log files can be controlled by the parameter MAXLOGFILES.

59) What is the difference between a privilege and a role?
       A privilege is the authority to perform a certain act or command.
       A role is a collection of privileges and roles that can be assigned to a user.

60) How many types of cloning are available?
      Adclone
      Rapidclone

61) What is LoGWRiter (LGWR)?
       LGWR is the background process that writes redo information from redo log buffers to the log files.

62) What is the difference between a temporary table space and a permanent table space?
       A temporary tablespace provides temporary storage during the processing of database function, such as sorting; whereas
       A permanent tablespace is used to store permanent database objects, such as tables, partitions, indexes and clusters.

      Password files and
      Parameter files
      are the disk components.

66) What is a primary key?
       A primary key is an attribute (or a collection of attributes) that uniquely identifies each row in the table. In other words, each entity instance in a table must be unique; and therefore, primary key is a way of ensuring this.
       tains data types for attributes and indexes.

67) What is a foreign key?
       A foreign key is an attribute in a child table that matches the primary key value in the parent table.
