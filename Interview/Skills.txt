Pro-Tips for Landing Remote Roles

The "On-Call" Setup: In interviews, mention your home office setup. 
Employers want to know you have a stable internet connection and a reliable 
way to respond to 2 AM database crashes (PagerDuty) without delay.

Get Certified: Remote employers rely on credentials to verify your skills. 
The Oracle Certified Professional (OCP) and OCI Database Specialist are the 
current gold standards.

Focus on Autonomous: Familiarity with Oracle Autonomous Database is a huge 
plus for WFH roles, as it demonstrates you understand modern, hands-off administration.
