5) What is the difference between dictionary managed tablespace 
   and locally managed tablespace?
   In dictionary managed tablespace, free block information is 
   maintained in data dictionary cache there by increases IO. 
   In locally managed tablespace, the same information is maintained in 
   datafile header itself there by reducing the IO. Hence LMT is better than DMT

6) How to change the segment management type for an existing tablespace?
    Once defined, we cannot change segment space management for any tablespace

7) What happens when you take a tablespace/datafile offline immediate?
     Any existing transactions will be stopped and datafiles of this 
     tablespace need recovery when we make them online

8) How to identify which datafiles are modified today?
    By looking at the timestamp of the files at OS level

9) What is the new feature of 11g tablespace management?
    Encryption of the tablespace

10) What is bigfile tablespace and its use?
    It gives easy managebility for VLDB by providing terabytes 
    size to a single datafile itself
	
11) How will do capacity planning for your production databases?
    We will take every quarter for normal databases and every week 
    for critical and fast growing databases.

12) What is OMF? What are its advantages and disadvantages?
    It helps in managing files by oracle automatically. But naming

13) How you will get timezone of database?
    NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT

14) How will you find out the current users who are using temporary

16) How to check SCN of the database?

17) What is the relation between db_files and maxdatafiles?
    Both will specify how many max datafiles can be there in the database

18) How do you add a datafile to a tablespace?
    You can add a datafile to a tablespace by using the 
    ALTER TABLESPACE ADD DATAFILE SIZE; 
    statement.

19) What are the advantages of using locally managed tablespace?
      Reduced contention on data dictionary tables
      No rollback generated
      No coalescing required
      Reduced recursive space management

20) What view would you use to determine free space in a tablespace?
      The DBA_FREE_SPACE view can be used to determine free space in a tablespace.
