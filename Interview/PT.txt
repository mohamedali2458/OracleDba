Top 15 Performance Tuning Interview Questions for Experienced Oracle DBAs.

1️⃣ System Hangs & Core Internals
1. Oracle database hangs with no waits, no CPU, no I/O. Sessions are connected but idle.
 👉 Which internal components can still block progress, and how do you validate them?

2. Explain why Oracle still generates redo for NOLOGGING operations.
 👉 What exactly is protected, and what is not?

3. What breaks first when LGWR is slow versus when DBWR is slow?
 👉 Explain real production symptoms and wait events.

4. How does Oracle decide which buffers are aged out when the buffer cache is full?
 👉 Explain touch count, LRU, and hot/cold buffer behavior.

5. What is the exact difference between a latch, mutex, spinlock, and enqueue?
 👉 Give one real Oracle use case for each.

2️⃣ Recovery Awareness (Performance Impact)
6. If control files are multiplexed and all copies are corrupted identically,
 👉 what recovery options remain and what are the performance implications?

7. Why does Oracle not checkpoint on COMMIT, even though transaction consistency is guaranteed?
 👉 Explain the performance trade-off involved.

3️⃣ Performance Analysis – The Killer Zone
8. AWR shows high DB CPU, but top SQL statements have low elapsed time.
 👉 Where is the CPU actually being consumed?

9. Why can an index rebuild make performance worse, even if it reduces index height?
 👉 Explain clustering factor, buffer gets, and execution plan changes.

10. Explain a real production scenario where a hash join performs worse than nested loops,
 even on large datasets.

4️⃣ Optimizer & Execution Plan Behavior
11. A SQL runs fast in SQL*Plus but slow in the application.
 👉 Which optimizer-level causes do you investigate first (before blaming the app)?

12. How do bind peeking, adaptive plans, and SQL plan baselines interact —
 👉 and in what scenarios do they conflict with each other?

13. When and why would you disable adaptive features in Oracle 19c?
 👉 What risks does this introduce?

5️⃣ Memory & Cursor Management
14. Explain why increasing PGA can unexpectedly increase TEMP usage.
 👉 Cover workarea sizing, spills, and concurrency effects.
 
15. What happens internally when cursor_sharing = FORCE breaks an application?
 👉 Explain parsing behavior, plan instability, and functional side effects.








Most important Performance Tuning Tasks
=======================================
Monitor CPU, Memory, Swap usage

SGA size should be around 60% of physical RAM

library cache hit ratio > 95 (CURSOR_SHARING)

dictionary cache hit ratio > 95

Buffer cache hit ratio > 90

Watch for top 5 wait Events (V$SYSTEM_EVENTS, V$SESSWAIT)

OLTP sorting should happen in memory (PGA)

Distribute data files to avoid hot spots.

separate data and indexes on separate disks

tablespace striping

Put Redo files on fastest disks

OLTP Queries Should have fewer FTS

shrink segments - HWM

Use MULTI_BLOCK_READ_COUNT and/or large block size for DSS

avoid row migration – reorg tables

Stop archiving if not necessary – non production instances only

use nologging at appropriate places (index creation, CTAS etc.)

use direct path load for SQL Loaders(no triggers will be fired) and exp

pin lookup tables

pin frequently used stored procs

setup shared server only when you are low on RAM

Monitor free space & growth – pre allocate extents for large data loads

schedule jobs to collect regular stats

rebuild indexes

use partitioning

use external tables

use LMT with UNIFORM size & Auto segment management

use Automatic UNDO instead of manual with proper UNDO_RENTNTION

backup/export during low activity hours. Use only
RMAN(this will not generate more redo during hot
backup)
