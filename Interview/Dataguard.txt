Oracle dataguard – Interview Questions

1. What is the use of standby redolog?

The Advantage of having Standby Redo Logs is that every record written into the Online RedoLogs of the Primary Database
is transferred to the Standby database and written into the Standby Redo Logs at the same time.
Therefore, it minimizes the probability of Data Loss on the Standby Database.

For real time apply, it is mandatory to have standby redologs on standby database.

Without Standby Redo Logs, an Archived Redo Log is created by the RFS process and when it has completed,
this Archived Redo Log is applied to the Standby Database by the MRP process. An incomplete ArchiveLog 
file cannot be applied on the Standby Database and will not be used in a Failover situation. 
This causes a certain data loss.

If you have Standby Redo Logs whenever a record is inserted into oracle redolog, the RFS process will 
write into the Standby Redo Log of standby and it gets applied by MRP, which ensures real time sync. 
When a log switch occurs, the Archiver Process of the Standby Database will archive this Standby Redo 
Log to an Archived Redo Log, while the MRP process applies the information to the Standby Database. 
In a Failover situation, you will also have access to the information already written in the Standby 
Redo Logs, so the information will not be lost.

Oracle recommends to keep standby redologs on both primary and standby database. (Though SLR is not mandatory for 
primary, it will make the switchover quick without any additional DBA activity. i.e If you don’t have standby 
redologs on primary, whenever we do switchover, we need to create the SLR .


2. How many standby redo logs need to be created? What should be the size?

It is recommended to create one additional standby redo log group per thread. And its size should be same as that of primary redo log.

Suppose, we have 4 number of redo log groups of 200M on primary, Then we need to create 5 standby redo logs of 200M.

Why extra:
During heavy DML activity on primary, this extra standby log will help as a buffer in coping with the sync up.

Please note, Oracle recommends not to multiplex the standby redologs on , As it puts unnecessary i/o overhead during log shipping.


3. Explain different protection modes in dataguard?

There are three modes.

1. MAXIMUM PROTECTION
This mode provides maximum protection. It guarantees zero data loss. In this mode the redo/transaction data must 
be written to both primary redo log and standby redo log. For any reason(mostly N/W issue) if it is unable to 
write to standby, Then primary database will get shutdown. i.e if a user commits transaction, then that commit will 
not be be completed, unless primary receives a confirmation that write is completed on standby.

2. MAXIMUM AVAILABILITY:
It provides the highest level of data protection that is possible without affecting the availability of the 
primary database. Transactions are not allowed to commit until all redo data are written to the online redo 
logs and propagated to at least one synchronized secondary database. If for any reason, the primary database 
cannot propagate its redo stream to one secondary database, the primary will NOT shutdown and operates 
as it were in maximum performance mode until issues are fixed.

3. MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE:(default one)
This is the default protection mode. With this protection mode, a transaction is committed as soon as the 
redo data needed to recover the transaction is written to the local (online) redo log.

4. What is snapshot standby database.
Snapshot standby is a feature in Oracle 11g that allows doing a read-write operation on the standby database i. e
we can convert the physical standby database to snapshot standby for testing purpose.  On that, we can do all 
types of testing (BOTH READ/WRITE) or can be used as a development database (which is an exact replication 
of production). Once the testing is over we can again convert the snapshot standby database to physical standby. 
Once it is converted physical standby database, whatever changes were done to the snapshot standby will be reverted.

5. Suppose my dataguard setup is having one primary and standby and it is in maximum protection mode. 
Can i convert the standby to snapshot standby database?
No we cannot covert the standby database to snapshot in maximum protection, when this is the only standby db.  
Because in maximum protection mode, transaction data must be written to standby redo, before proceeding further.

6. What is the difference between switchover and failover:
A switchover means just switching roles between the primary database and standby db.
The primary database changed to a standby role, and the standby database changed to the primary role.
This is typically done for planned maintenance of the primary db server.

A failover is when the primary database fails and one of the standby databases is transitioned to take 
over the primary role. Failover is performed only in the event of a catastrophic failure of the primary 
database, and there is no possibility of recovering the primary database in a timely manner. Failover 
may or may not result in data loss depending on the protection mode in effect at the time of the failover.

7. What is the process to apply a psu patch in dataguard setup.
 Make sure lag between primary and standby is zero.
 Cancel the recovery (MRP) on standby.
 Shutdown standby db and listener.
 Apply patch to  the standby database oracle home binary using opatch apply command.
 Once patch applied to binary, startup the listener and standby in mount stage or OPEN(if active dataguard).
 Now shutdown primary db and listener.
 Apply patch to primary database home binary using opatch apply command.
 Once patch applied to binary, startup open  the primary database and listener. 
 Start the MRP recovery process on standby.
 Run post patching script catbundle.sql(if 11g)  or datapatch -verbose command( if 12c) on primary database 

8. What is fal_client and fal_server parameter:
FAL Means – Fetch Archive log. FAL_CLIENT and FAL_SERVER parameters are used on standby database for archive gap resolution.

FAL_SERVER and FAL_CLIENT parameters are required on standby database only.

FAL_SERVER: Specify an Oracle Net Service Name (TNS-Alias or Connect Descriptor) that points to the Database from where 
the missing ArchiveLog(s) should be requested i.e the tns alias of the primary db.

FAL_CLIENT: Specify an Oracle Net Service Name (TNS-Alias or Connect Descriptor) that points  from FAL_SERVER TO standby db. 
i.e the tns alias of the standby db. This parameter has been deprecated.

fal_server = ‘primdb’
fal_client = ‘stdbydb’

9. What are different types of dataguard and their difference.
There are three types of dataguard setups. PHYSICAL, LOGICAL and SNAPSHOT.

PHYSICAL STANDBY:
A physical standby database is an exact, block-for-block copy of a primary database. A physical standby is
maintained as an exact copy through a process called REDO APPLY, in which redo data received from a
primary database is continuously applied to a physical standby database using the database recovery 
mechanisms. So it will be always in sync with primary.

This Standby database can be opened in read only mode(knows as ACTIVE DATA GUARD), for reporting purpose. 
Most of the corporations use physical standby for dataguard configuration.

Physical standby database is suitable for high availability and disaster recovery.

LOGICAL STANDBY:
The logical standby database is kept synchronized with the primary database through 
SQL APPLY, which transforms the data in the redo received from the primary database 
into SQL statements and then executes the SQL statements on the standby database. 
So it contains same logical information as that of production, but physical structure 
of data can be different.

Logical standby is suitable for reporting purpose, Where we can do read,write operations. 
(But we should not modify the standby objects, that exists on primary). This also helps 
in near zero down time database upgrade.

SNAPSHOT STANDBY:

10. What is standby_file_management parameter oracle.
Standby_file_management parameter can be have two values. MANUAL or AUTO(Recommended).

AUTO – > Datafiles created on primary will be create automatically on standby.

PHYSICAL STANDBY:
A physical standby database is an exact, block-for-block copy of a primary database. A physical standby is
maintained as an exact copy through a process called REDO APPLY, in which redo data received from a
primary database is continuously applied to a physical standby database using the database recovery mechanisms. So it will be always in sync with primary.

This Standby database can be opened in read only mode( knows as ACTIVE DATA GUARD), for reporting purpose. Most of the corporations use physical standby for dataguard
configuration.

Logical standby is suitable for reporting purpose, Where we can do read,write operations. ( But we should not modify the standby objects, that exists on primary). This also helps in  near zero down time database upgrade.

SNAPSHOT STANDBY:


10. What is standby_file_management parameter oracle.
Standby_file_management parameter can be have two values. MANUAL or AUTO(Recommended).

AUTO – > Datafiles created on primary will be create automatically on standby . 
MANUAL – > Datafiles created on primary, will not be replicated to standby. 
The datafile need to be created manually on Standby.

11.  With standby_file_management set to AUTO, If I rename a datafile in primary, will the changes be propagated to standby. 
No, for renaming  a data file, the rename command need to be run on standby database as well.

12. What is active dataguard. Does it needs additional licensing?
Active dataguard means, the standby database is open with read only mode, when redo logs are getting applied in real time.

Below are the benefit of using active dataguard.
  Reporting queries can be offloaded to standby database.
  Physical block corruptions are repaired automatically either at primary or physical standby database.
  RMAN backups can be initiated from standby, instead  of primary which will reduce cpu load from primary.
NOTE – To use active dataguard, you need additional license from oracle

13. Lets say, few of archive logs are missing from primary db server, before it is shipped to standby. In this case, How you will resolve the gap and keep the standby in sync with that of primary??
Recover the standby database by taking an incremental backup of primary db (using scn of standby db).

14.The support DBA , added a tempfile on primary database, but the tempfile is not reflecting on standby database despite, the standby_file_management is set to AUTO.
Adding tempfiles to TEMP tablespaces in primary database, will not automatically create on standby database. Because no redo is generated, while adding tempfile. So DBA have to add the temp file manually.

15. What are the different types of redo transport services in dataguard.
1 . ARCH transportation mode:

In this mode, logs are sent by ARCH process. LNS process is not active here. Also standby redologs are not mandatory. i.e Real time APPLY will not happen here. In this mode.  Archive logs will be copied to standby server and will be applied there.

2. SYNC and ASYNC transportation mode:(real time apply) 

In below cases, standby redologs will be required.  Redo is read and sent from redo log buffer to standby by LNS process.

If redo log buffer is flushed to online redolog, before redo being sent to standby, then LNS will read the online redo log files and sent to standby.

SYNC(SYNCHRONOUS):

This mode is used for maximum protection and maximum availability protection mode. The synchronous redo transport mode transmits redo data synchronously with respect to transaction commitment. A transaction cannot commit until all redo generated by that transaction has been successfully sent to every standby destinations.

ASYNC(ASYNCHRONOUS):

This mode is used for maximum performance mode. A transaction can commit without waiting for the redo generated by that transaction to be successfully sent to any redo transport destination that uses the asynchronous redo transport mode.

16. Which parameter defines the attributes of redo log transport service.
log_archive_dest_2(n) – > This parameter defines the service name of the standby database and whether this is SYNC or ASYNC mode and the attributes like AFFIRM/NOAFFIRM.

Apart From that , there are additional attributes like ,

17. What are the different types of Apply services in dataguard.
REDO APPLY:

With redo apply, apply services waits for a standby redo log file to be archived before applying the redo to standby. 

REAL TIME APPLY:

If the real-time apply feature is enabled, then apply services can apply redo data ( either from redo log buffer or redo log file)as it is received, without waiting for the current standby redo log file to be archived.
